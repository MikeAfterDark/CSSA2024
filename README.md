# Game Loop

## Gameplay

Player will spawn (wake up) in a room of a mansion. There is a ghost wandering around the mansion that will try to attack you.

The player is stuck in the endless loop, but they can earn power ups through exploring the map and trigger the next loop.

After each loop, the ghost would get stronger (faster, more HP, more agro), if the player get caught by the ghost, it's game over.
We can also integrate day/night logic for more interesting gameplay, when night fall, the ghost experience power up etc

After collect enough power up, the player can now face the ghost defeat it and exit from the loop.
